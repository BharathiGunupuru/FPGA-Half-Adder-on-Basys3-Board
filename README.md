# FPGA-Half-Adder-on-Basys3-Board
Designed a half adder on the Basys3 FPGA using [VHDL/Verilog]. Inputs were mapped to switches, and outputs to LEDs via an XDC file. Synthesized and implemented in Xilinx Vivado, generating a device diagram, utilization report, and power analysis. This project showcases basic digital design on FPGA hardware.
